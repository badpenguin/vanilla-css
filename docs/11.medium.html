	<h1>How to Turn a Job Opening into a Dream Job for Top Tech Talent</h1>

	<small>blockquote test</small>

	<blockquote>The general finding that “There are order-of-magnitude differences among programmers” has been confirmed
		by many other studies of professional programmers (Curtis 1981, Mills 1983, DeMarco and Lister 1985, Curtis et
		al. 1986, Card 1987, Boehm and Papaccio 1988, Valett and McGarry 1989, Boehm et al 2000).

	<h4>In the beginning (some&nbsp;history)</h4>
	<p>Roughly 2 years ago I joined Obvious Corp. to work on the software application, <em>medium.com</em> (which,
		you’re ~hopefully~ reading on).</p>
	<p>At the time, Medium had already gone through a series of “re-styles” (<em>A re-style is where designers ruin your
		life by coming up with something prettier than they had previously come up with, resulting in you having to
		rewrite a bunch of CSS/LESS/SASS/etc</em>). Because of these re-styles, there was a lot of built up cruft – the
		company was leaning pretty heavily on LESS’s language features, with page driven semantics,
		non-sprited/non-retina image assets, and other such things.</p>

	<hr>

	<small>ul test</small>

	<p>I dug through git and managed to pull out our old profile page implementation from back in 2012 ~shudder~. Check
		it out below and notice some of these unfortunate patterns:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>everything nested under a&nbsp;.<strong>profile-page</strong> class, with zero reusable components (also
			~almost~ everything is prefixed with&nbsp;<strong>.profile</strong>)
		</li>
		<li>super generic variable names like <strong>@link-color</strong> which weren’t scoped to anything, but
			presumably only to be used in <strong>profile-page.less</strong></li>
		<li>deep nesting (<strong>.profile-page&nbsp;.profile-posts&nbsp;.home-post-summary&nbsp;.home-post-collection-image
			img</strong> is an actual selector being generated below — super rough on perf)
		</li>
		<li>no image spriting</li>
		<li>no z-index scale, no font scale, no color scale, no scalesss…</li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<small>blockquote alternative test</small>

	<blockquote class="alternate">People were confused. And what’s worse, they were thinking they were writing CSS
		really well, when in reality they weren’t.

	<h1>Why Does Digital Advertising Suck?</h1>
	<div class="subtitle">It’s easy to blame the platforms for the blandification of advertising on the web, but the
		truth might be a little less palatable…
	</div>
	<p>A year or two ago I was pitching a piece of work to a very senior, hugely experienced creative at an advertising
		agency. As an example of the sort of content that amuses and is shared on the web, I showed him Double Rainbow
		Man — not the most up-to-date reference, I know, but a crowd pleaser 40million times over.</p>

	<hr>

	<small>code test</small>

	<p>Whenever I tried to download images, I would get <code><a href="#">ECONNRESET</a></code> errors. I start the
		program, download half an image and <strong>boom</strong>. Error.</p>

	<hr>

	<small>code test</small>

	<p>Open up your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file in your favorite text editor and add the following alias:</p>
	<pre>hello = "!echo \"Hello World\""<br># (the backslashes are for escaping the quotes.)</pre>
	<p>Now when you run <code>$ git hello</code> in your terminal, you’ll get <code>Hello World</code> as the output.
		Awesome! Armed with this knowledge, let’s walk through the 3 examples outlined above and the aliases I’ve used
		to accomplish them.</p>

	<h3>Start Up Performance</h3>
	<p><span class="highlight">React Native has a start up overhead mostly caused by having to inject the JavaScript bundle into JavaScriptCore (the VM used by React Native both on iOS and Android) and instantiate native modules and view managers.</span>
		Although the React Native team has come a long way in <a href="#">improving performance</a>, for Instagram
		integration we wanted to measure this gap to figure if the tradeoffs would make sense for us. To do so, we
		ported the existing native <em>Edit Profile</em> view to React Native. Along the way, we built product
		infrastructure that started being used by product teams in parallel (e.g. navigation, translations, core
		components).</p>

	<h3>Image with caption</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*78qeb8R1AjVmSPUP25sOQA.png">
		<figcaption>
			<a href="#" rel="noopener"><em>Michael Nino Everson</em></a> <em>’s entire portfolio is built around a
			single project&#8202;—&#8202;SoundCloud for iOS. The process that he follows is described in-depth and is
			backed up with great examples of imagery, giving a clear insight into the way he&nbsp;works.</em>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<h3>More list example</h3>
	<p>The overview section should come first. The reviewer should be able quickly understand what the product is about
		and how it functions. Here are a subsections to include in the “overview”:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><em>Purpose of the project</em>&#8202;—&#8202;Why was this project started?</li>
		<li><em>Objective&#8202;—&#8202;</em>What were the deliverables?</li>
		<li><em>Project duration&#8202;—&#8202;</em>How long did it take?</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>OL example</h3>

	<p>Millions of years later we are still telling stories about what just happened and why we feel the way we feel, so
		we’d do well to remember two things:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Every feeling is a feeling about change.</li>
		<li>Every change implies a story.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>So whether it’s a news story in a paper, or a marketing story about a product, whether it’s an anecdote you tell
		your friends or the tale of a great romance—every story is the story of change.</p>
